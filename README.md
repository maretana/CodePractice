# Code Practice
This repository is meant to hold a copy of my solutions to different coding challenges. Solutions are grouped together by programming language.

## Methodology
Each folder will list how to run the files for that language and which tools I used. All solutions should implement some sort of TDD.

### Disclaimer
I'm adding old challenges to start this repo which is why some of the files don't have my custom tests. New solutions will include all tests I do.

## Sources
Each file should say where the specification for each problem is located at. I will try to keep this list updated with places where I got the different challenges from:
